# Fizz-Buzz kata
This kata has been built in Elixir and tested in ExUnit.

This app works with passing a range of numbers to a
function called 'fizzbuzz(number)'.
This function will look to see if the numbers passed
to as arguments are divisible by 15, 3 or 5. And will return fizzbuzz, fizz and buzz respectively.

I have used ExUnit to test drive the development.
